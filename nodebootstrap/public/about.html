    Analyzr was born out of a need to accurately and objectively summarize the mood of articles.</p>

    As programmers, we read a lot of tech articles, and have noticed that these articles portray companies,
    technologies, and people with certain biases.<br>
    As readers we pick up on these sentiments, but as 
    programmers we ask: Can computers do the same?<br><br>
                 
    <!--
      Analyzr takes in the URL of an article and      -->

      Analyzr allows users to input the address of an article and using natural language processing 
      (via Alchemy API)  finds the topics which are most relevant to the article. 
      It then calculates the sentiment the article has towards each topic and presents the data to the user: <br><br>

        <h3 class="panel-title">Visual Depiction</h3>
      </div> <!-- /panel-heading -->
      <div class="panel-body">
      Using D3's modeling software, graphs of the topics in the article are created, showing both
      the topic's relevance to the article, as well as its "sentiment value", in a tooltip. 
    

    
        <br><br>Analyzr allows filtering by subject type. This includes broad filters like "Most Relevant" and "Only Positive",
         and more specific ones like "Country" and "Operating System". 
        Analyzr is able to break topics down into over 100 different 
      categories. <br>
        <!--
    The data is graphed on an x-axis from negative to positive sentiment.  Each subject is colored to 
    match its sentiment and its size represents the relevance to the article. insert picture of graph

      For a more detailed analysis of the article, a table of the topics is displayed below the graph.
     Each listing contains a small breakdown
