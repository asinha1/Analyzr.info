    Analyzr was born out of a need to accurately and objectively summarize the mood of articles.</p>

    As programmers, we read a lot of tech articles, and have noticed that many of these articles 
    discuss the same trending topics in the tech industry. Each article has a positive/negative 
    spin on each subject, whether that subject be a person, company, technology, or other entity.<br> 
    As readers we pick up on these sentiments, but as programmers we ask: Can computers do the same?
    And if they can, can we utilize them to make understanding articles easier?<br>

              <!--
      Analyzr takes in the URL of an article and finds the topics which are most relevant to the article. 
      It then calculates the sentiment/mood the article has towards each topic and presents the data in dynamic 
      graphs and tables. <br>
      -->
      Analyzr allows users to input the address of an article, and using natural language processing 
      (via Alchemy API), extracts a list of topics mentioned in the article, and a detailed analysis
      of the article's sentiment towards those topics. <br>
      Analyzr then presents the information in a variety of ways:<br>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Visual Depiction</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
      Using D3's modeling software, graphs of the topics in the article are created, showing both
      the topic's relevance to the article, as well as its "sentiment value", in a tooltip. <br>
      A drop down menu lets the user switch between major groups of topics, for example Companies,
      People, or Governments. <br>
      Visual relation to the relevance and sentiment via color transitions and size changes are used
      as an aid to the user.
      <!--
    The data is graphed on an x-axis from negative to positive sentiment.  Each subject is colored to 
    match its sentiment and its size represents the relevance to the article. insert picture of graph

      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Concise Tables</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
      For a more detailed analysis of the article, a table of the topics being displayed on the screen 
      and relevant data about them, is displayed under the graph. Each listing contains a small breakdown
      of the topic, useful links, and a more detailed breakdown of the sentiment and relevance scores.
              <!--
     The raw data is presented in a table.  Each subject is presented along with its relevence and 
     sentiment to the article.  insert picture of table

      <div class="panel-body">
    Hovering over a datapoint highlights the data in both the graph and table.  The graph also displays 
    a popup showing the data for that subject.

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
      To accommodate many styles of articles, analyzr allows filtering by subject type.  By default analyzr 
      will display the most relevant subjects, but you can filter by subject type.  Analyzr can detect hundreds 
      of subject types ranging from countries to operating systems, and allows you to filter the data by the 
      types it detects.
