    Analyzr was born out of a need to accurately and objectively summarize the mood of articles.</p>

    As programmers, we read a lot of tech articles, and have noticed that many of these articles 
    discuss the same trending topics in the tech industry.  Each article has a positive/negative 
    spin on each subject, whether that subject be a person, company, technology, or other entity. 
    As readers we pick up on these sentiments, but as programmers we ask: Can computers do the same?

      Analyzr takes in the URL of an article and finds the topics which are most relevant to the article. 
      It then calculates the sentiment/mood the article has towards each topic and presents the data in dynamic 
      graphs and tables.

      <div class="panel-body">
      To accommodate many styles of articles, analyzr allows filtering by subject type.  By default analyzr 
      will display the most relevant subjects, but you can filter by subject type.  Analyzr can detect hundreds 
      of subject types ranging from countries to operating systems, and allows you to filter the data by the 
      types it detects.
