    Analyzr was born out of a need to accurately and objectively summarize the 
    mood of articles. <br> 
    Being programmers, we read A LOT of tech articles, most talking about the 
    same trending topics in the industry. 
    And for a long time, we would compare these articles and their 
    (sometimes justified) biases in one of two possible ways:
    <br>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">reading all of them, one by one, and developing 
    a thorough understanding of each</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">delegating the reading of each article to 
    friends, and then discuss them at length with eachother</li>
    </ul>
    However, we realized that both of these methods has a serious flaw: The reader's 
    inner bias. The articles' true sentiment was
    lost in the distortion caused by our own biases, meaning that two people 
    reading the same article could, and did, come to vastly different 
    conclusions as to what the article truly felt about whatever was today's 
    trending topic. <br>
    This problem wasnt only limited to the tech industry. Everything from blog 
    posts to political articles are shaped not just by the writer, but by the 
    reader as well. What we needed was a way to eliminate the leanings of the 
    reader from the equation.<br>
    Analyzr does just that. Using NLP, we are able to gather information about 
    topics the articles covered, and the articles sentiment about them, in a 
    quick and objective manner. We then display the information in easy to 
    read, yet informative, graphs and tables.</p>
